#ismus_relations
I started this project when I decided to move a project I was working on from D7 to D8. I had used the relation module in
the D7 project, but to this date, there is no port of it to D8. Discussions on the project page are leading towards discontinuing
the project for D8, and use just custom entities instead.

##Sandbox
This is a sandbox module right now, I'm just experimenting with this, but hopefully I will be able to get a stable version
working soon.
